# Hospital Management System Prototype
### Overview
This Hospital Management System is a Python-based software designed to maintain the medical records of patients, manage appointments, and handle hospital admin operations. The system has three roles: Admin, Doctor, and Patient. However, only the Admin role is active, managing the other roles, while the Doctor and Patient are passive objects used for data storage.

This prototype is a basic system that allows the admin to manage doctors, view patients, assign doctors to patients, and more. The system starts with hardcoded patient data and enables essential hospital functionalities like booking appointments and managing patient data.
